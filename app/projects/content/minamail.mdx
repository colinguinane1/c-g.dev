Minamail is an application that solves all your problem by uniting all your mail into one app, with support for instant push notifications, and AI powered summaries and responses.

It was born out of my frustration with current mail apps forcing ads and sponsored content into your inbox, and apps (Apple Mail), that dont give you instant push notifications for your inbox's.

Minamail will never have ads or sponsored content in your inbox, and I am making every effort to give all supported inbox providers instant push notifications. It also uses more mobile friendly design than other competitors. 

You will be able to add multiple gmail acccounts for example to your Minamail account. And then wether on iOS, Android or Web you can sign back into just your Minamail account and have access to all your accounts without having to reauthenticate. (You can revoke access any time from your settings (Google, Outlook Settings etc.))

## Features

- All your emails behind one password
- Crossplatform. Support planned for Web, iOS, Android.
- AI Summaries and Replies
- HTML Email Templates

On my journey to become a full-stack developer, after learning the basics i found myself wanting to dive deep into full-stack development and create an app that has an appealing and easily understandable front-end with a back-end.

I had been making my apps in NEXT.JS up to this point and after researching i set out to create a Blogging App, and my initial tech stack was:
- Next.JS
- Server Actions 
- Clerk Authentication
- PostgresSQL
- Prisma
- ShadCN/ui
